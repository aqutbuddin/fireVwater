12
TODO: 
1) Update the sim count number above to be the exact
number of simulations needed to completely eliminate fire.
2) I initially started at 100 simulations, then moved my way down
going from 100->75->50->25->15->10. I realized my number was somewhere 
between 10-15 simulaitions, so I went to 13, moved down to 11 and 12, 
and 12 was the correct number.
